/*
When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way,
first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.

Before you start refactoring, make suer you have a solid suite of tests.
These tests must be self-checking.

Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake,
it is easy to find where the bug is.

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
